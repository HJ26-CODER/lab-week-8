            <p>
                My full name is <strong>Harshjot Singh Chagger</strong> and I’m basically from <strong>Punjab, India</strong>.I was born in Montreal, 
                Canada but because of some <strong>financial problems</strong>, my parents decided to moved me to India when I was 
                just six months old. I lived in India for approximately 16 years with the rest of my family including 
                my grandparents, and my uncle’s family. I still get emotional when I think about my younger days, 
                as they were quite fun. I do remember complaining about a lot of things when I was 14  but now 
                when I look back I miss all of my friends and my family back in India. I came back to Canada 
                2 years ago and that’s the only reason for me to be able to speak three different languages including 
                Hindi, English, Punjabi. I Also worked in a <em>garage door company</em>  last year just to gain some experience
                and also to complete my work experience requirements for high school and it was quite fun for me.
                Computers are one of my <em>favourite interest areas</em> and I like <em>spending time on my pc  gaming </em>  and exploring, 
                which I bought a year ago. I don’t like sharing my pc with everybody except my younger sister, as she is 
                also in high school, as we only have one pc between both of us.
